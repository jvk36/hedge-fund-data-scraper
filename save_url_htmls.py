# NOTE ON BELOW CODE THAT WAS REFACTORED AS IT DID NOT REPLACE SOME SPECIAL 
# CHARACTERS (-, .) WITH UNDERSCORE:
# 
# Breakdown of the call re.sub(r'[^\w\-_\.]', '_', url): 
#
# re.sub(): This function from the re module is used for substituting a regex 
# match with a replacement string. Here, it replaces matches with the 
# underscore (_).
#
# r'[^\w\-_\.]': This is the regular expression pattern. Let's decompose it:
#
# \w: This matches any "word" character, which includes letters, digits, and 
#     underscores ([A-Za-z0-9_]).
# \-: This specifically matches a literal hyphen (-). We escape the hyphen (\), 
#     so itâ€™s treated as a character and not part of a range.
# \.: This matches a literal dot (.), escaped (\) because the dot in regular 
#     expressions is normally a wildcard character that matches any character.
# [^\w\-_\.]: The square brackets [] define a character class (a group of 
#             characters you're looking for). The ^ inside the brackets negates 
#             the class, meaning "match anything that is not in this set." 
#
# Therefore, this pattern matches any character that is not a word character 
# (\w), a hyphen (-), or a dot (.).
